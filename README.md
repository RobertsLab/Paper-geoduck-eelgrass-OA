### Abstract 


Ocean acidification research is increasingly incorporating multiple stressors and natural pH variability into biological response studies for more compelling understanding of the effects of projected ocean conditions. In this study eelgrass habitats, environmental heterogeneity across four estuarine bays, and proteomics were applied to examine low pH effects on geoduck physiology under different natural regimes. Juvenile geoduck (14.0 +/- 0.85 mm) were deployed in eelgrass and adjacent unvegetated habitats for 30 days whilst monitoring pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen and salinity. Protein content of ctendia tissue was measured with a two-phase proteomic analysis method that first included the discovery of 8,077 detectable proteins using Data Independent Acquisition (DIA), followed by Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) to determine abundance of targeted proteins. Across the four bays pH fluctuated daily by 0.43±0.12 pH units, and was significantly lower in unvegetated habitats (7.54∓0.23SD) compared to eelgrass (7.88∓0.17), however no pH response was measured in geoduck growth, survival, or proteomic profiles. Biometric parameters, including three targeted proteins involved in metabolism, growth, and protein stabilization, correlated negatively with mean temperature and positively with dissolved oxygen variability, indicating that these environmental factors were more influential to geoduck physiology than pH. These results demonstrates the importance of incorporating natural settings into OA research in tandem with laboratory studies, which can be accomplished using systems such as eelgrass beds in estuaries. Geoduck OA research is in its infancy, and these results are a snapshot into geoduck physiology at one developmental stage with with present-day pH levels in Washington State. Further foundational studies are needed to elucidate the species’ pH limits for each developmental stage, and with genetically diverse individuals from various locations along the population’s range.
